        <p>This vegetarian curry is incredibly thick and rich, thanks to cooked-down red lentils. For serving, spoon over rice or scoop up with flatbreads.</p>
        <p>This red lentil curry is rich and hearty. It's great as a main meal rather than a side dish like the more traditional Indian dhal. Don't let the ingredient list faze you â€” this is an easy dish to make. This dish is excellent served with basmati rice.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups red lentils</li>
            <li>3 cups water, or more as needed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons curry paste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon curry powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger</li>
            <li>1 (14.25 ounce) can tomato puree</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash lentils in cold water until water runs clear.</li>
            <li>Put lentils in a pot with enough water to cover; bring to a boil and reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer, adding water as needed to keep lentils covered, until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onions in hot oil until caramelized, about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix together curry paste, curry powder, turmeric, cumin, chili powder, salt, sugar, garlic, and ginger in a large bowl; stir into onions. Increase heat to high and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in tomato puree and lentils; cook until warmed through.</li>
        </ol>
